## Password Strength

The strength indicator evaluates passwords based on:
- Length (longer is stronger)
- Character diversity (more character types = stronger)
- Bonus points for very long passwords (24+ characters)

Strength levels:
- **Weak** (Red): Basic passwords with limited length/diversity
- **Fair** (Orange): Moderate strength passwords
- **Good** (Yellow): Strong passwords with good length and diversity
- **Strong** (Green): Very strong passwords with excellent security

## Security

- All password generation happens locally in your browser
- No passwords are sent to any server or stored anywhere
- Uses JavaScript's `Math.random()` for password generation
- Cryptographically secure random generation recommended for high-security use cases

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers that support:
- ES6 JavaScript
- CSS Flexbox
- Clipboard API (for copy functionality)
